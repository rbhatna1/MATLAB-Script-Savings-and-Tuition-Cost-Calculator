# MATLAB-Script-Savings-and-Tuition-Cost-Calculator

## Overview
This MATLAB script calculates the savings over 18 years with monthly contributions and compares it against the tuition costs for Arts, Science, and Engineering programs. It determines if the saved amount is sufficient to cover the tuition fees and calculates the optimal monthly contribution required to meet the tuition costs.

## Version
- **Version 1**: Calculate and plot savings vs tuition costs.
- **Version 2**: Determine if savings are sufficient for selected programs and calculate optimal monthly contributions.

## Sections
### 1. Version 1: Savings and Tuition Costs Calculation
- **Monthly Savings Calculation**: Calculate the total savings over 18 years with monthly contributions and interest.
- **Tuition Cost Calculation**: Calculate the annual tuition costs for Arts, Science, and Engineering programs over 22 years.
- **Total Tuition Calculation**: Calculate the total tuition fees for 4 years for each program.
- **Display Results**: Display the total savings and tuition costs.
- **Plot Results**: Plot the savings and tuition costs over time.

### 2. Version 2: Optimize Monthly Contributions
- **User Input for Program Selection**: Prompt the user to select a program (Arts, Science, Engineering).
- **Check Savings Sufficiency**: Determine if the current savings are sufficient to cover the tuition costs for the selected program.
- **Calculate Optimal Monthly Contribution**: Calculate the optimal monthly contribution required to meet the tuition costs if the current savings are insufficient.

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in MATLAB.
2. **View Savings and Tuition Costs**: The script will display the total savings and tuition costs for each program.
3. **Select Program**: Follow the prompt to select a program to optimize (Arts, Science, Engineering).
4. **View Results**: The script will display whether the savings are sufficient and calculate the optimal monthly contribution if needed.
